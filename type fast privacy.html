<h1>Privacy Policy for Type Fast</h1>
<p>This app provides built-in texts to use for typing practice. It also lets the users provide their own texts. User-provided texts are only stored locally, but since they are stored without encryption it is recommended to never enter any personal or sensitive information.</p>
<p>The user's internet connection is used for the sole purpose of syncing app settings between devices.
