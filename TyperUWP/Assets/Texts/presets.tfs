extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter. A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the door.) Nora. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. (To the PORTER, taking out her purse.) How much? Porter. Sixpence. Nora. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.) Yes, he is in. (Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.) Helmer (calls out from his room). Is that my little lark twittering out there? Nora (busy opening some of the parcels). Yes, it is! Helmer. Is it my little squirrel bustling about? Nora. Yes! Helmer. When did my squirrel come home? Nora. Just now. (Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.) Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought. Helmer. Don't disturb me. (A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.) Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again? Nora. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise. Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly. Nora. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money. Helmer. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due. Nora. Pooh! we can borrow until then. Helmer. Nora! (Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.) The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--Nora (putting her hands over his mouth). Oh! don't say such horrid things. Helmer. Still, suppose that happened,--what then? Nora. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care whether I owed money or not. Helmer. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it? Nora. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were. Helmer. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle. Nora (moving towards the stove). As you please, Torvald. Helmer (following her). Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? (Taking out his purse.) Nora, what do you think I have got here? Nora (turning round quickly). Money! Helmer. There you are. (Gives her some money.) Do you think I don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time? Nora (counting). Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time. Helmer. Indeed it must. Nora. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better. Helmer. And what is in this parcel? Nora (crying out). No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening. Helmer. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself? Nora. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything. Helmer. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would particularly like to have. Nora. No, I really can't think of anything--unless, Torvald-- Helmer. Well? Nora (playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his). If you really want to give me something, you might--you might-- Helmer. Well, out with it! Nora (speaking quickly). You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it. Helmer. But, Nora-- Nora. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be fun? Helmer. What are little people called that are always wasting money? Nora. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn't it? Helmer (smiling). Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again. Nora. Oh but, Torvald-- Helmer. You can't deny it, my dear little Nora. (Puts his arm round her waist.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are! Nora. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can. Helmer (laughing). That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save anything! Nora (smiling quietly and happily). You haven't any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald. Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora. Nora. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities. Helmer. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today? Nora. Do I? Helmer. You do, really. Look straight at me. Nora (looks at him). Well? Helmer (wagging his finger at her). Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in town today? Nora. No; what makes you think that? Helmer. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's? Nora. No, I assure you, Torvald-- Helmer. Not been nibbling sweets? Nora. No, certainly not. Helmer. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two? Nora. No, Torvald, I assure you really-- Helmer. There, there, of course I was only joking. Nora (going to the table on the right). I should not think of going against your wishes. Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- (Going up to her.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt. Nora. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank? Helmer. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am looking forward to this evening. Nora. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald! Helmer. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't it? Nora. It's wonderful! Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent! Nora. I didn't find it dull. Helmer (smiling). But there was precious little result, Nora. Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces? Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over. Nora. Yes, it is really wonderful. Helmer. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands-- Nora (clapping her hands). No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I! It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (Taking his arm.) Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.

These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes. I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation. But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the streets. As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the cloathing of many thousands. There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast. The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art. I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value. I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasie, or a ragoust. I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter. I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds. I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children. Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us. I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another child. Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen. As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs. A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project, how well soever intended. But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the Emperor, was sold to his</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_A_x0020_Modest_x0020_Proposal><textEntry_A_x0020_Tale_x0020_of_x0020_Two_x0020_Cities i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">A Tale of Two Cities</title><text i:type="x:string">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of "the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them. II. The Mail It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty. With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind. There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all. Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey. "Wo-ho!” said the coachman. "So, then! One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!” "Halloa!” the guard replied. "What o'clock do you make it, Joe?” "Ten minutes, good, past eleven.” "My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!” The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close comp</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_A_x0020_Tale_x0020_of_x0020_Two_x0020_Cities><textEntry_Adventures_x0020_of_x0020_Huckleberry_x0020_Finn i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</title><text i:type="x:string">You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, "Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;" and "Don't scrunch up like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;" and pretty soon she would say, "Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to behave?" Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider. I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. That was good! Says I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. CHAPTER II. WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: "Who dah?" He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: "Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin." So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.

His voice makes me tremble.”&#xD;&#xD;The next time the Fox met the Lion he was not so much afraid, but he&#xD;kept a safe distance and said to himself, “I wish he would not make&#xD;such a noise!”&#xD;&#xD;The third time they met, the Fox was not frightened at all. He ran up&#xD;to the Lion, and said, “What are you roaring about?”&#xD;&#xD;And the Lion was so taken by surprise that, without saying a word, he&#xD;let the Fox walk away.&#xD;&#xD;It would not be safe for little foxes always to follow the example of&#xD;this one; but it is often true that what our fear makes seem a lion in&#xD;the way has no danger in it if we meet it bravely.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE DOG AND HIS SHADOW - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;A DOG once had a nice piece of meat for his dinner. Some say that it&#xD;was stolen, but others, that it had been given him by a butcher, which&#xD;we hope was the case.&#xD;&#xD;Dogs like best to eat at home, and he went trotting along with the meat&#xD;in his mouth, as happy as a king.&#xD;&#xD;On the dog’s way there was a stream with a plank across it. As the&#xD;water was still and clear, he stopped to take a look at it. What&#xD;should he see, as he gazed into its bright depths, but a dog as big as&#xD;himself, looking up at him, and lo! the dog had meat in his mouth.&#xD;&#xD;“I’ll try to get that,” said he; “then with both mine and his what a&#xD;feast I shall have!” As quick as thought he snapped at the meat, but in&#xD;doing so he had to open his mouth, and his own piece fell to the bottom&#xD;of the stream.&#xD;&#xD;Then he saw that the other dog had lost his piece, too. He went sadly&#xD;home. In trying to grasp a shadow he lost his substance.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;“MY child,” said a Crab to her son, “why do you walk so awkwardly? If&#xD;you wish to make a good appearance, you should go straight forward, and&#xD;not to one side as you do so constantly.”&#xD;&#xD;“I do wish to make a good appearance, mamma,” said the young Crab; “and&#xD;if you will show me how, I will try to walk straight forward.”&#xD;&#xD;“Why, this is the way, of course,” said the mother, as she started off&#xD;to the right. “No, this is the way,” said she, as she made another&#xD;attempt, to the left.&#xD;&#xD;The little Crab smiled. “When you learn to do it yourself, you can&#xD;teach me,” he said, and went back to his play.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE FOX AND THE GRAPES - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;IT WAS a sultry day, and a Fox was almost famishing with hunger and&#xD;thirst. He was just saying to himself that anything would be acceptable&#xD;to him, when, looking up, he spied some great clusters of ripe, black&#xD;grapes hanging from a trellised vine.&#xD;&#xD;“What luck!” he said; “if only they weren’t quite so high, I should&#xD;be sure of a fine feast. I wonder if I can get them. I can think of&#xD;nothing that would so refresh me.”&#xD;&#xD;Jumping into the air is not the easiest thing in the world for a Fox to&#xD;do; but he gave a great spring and nearly reached the lowest clusters.&#xD;&#xD;“I’ll do better next time,” he said.&#xD;&#xD;[Illustration]&#xD;&#xD;He tried again and again, but did not succeed so well as at first.&#xD;Finding that he was losing his strength and that he had little chance&#xD;of getting the grapes, he walked slowly off, grumbling as he did so:&#xD;“The grapes are sour, and not at all fit for my eating. I’ll leave them&#xD;to the greedy birds. They eat anything.”&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE WOLF AND THE CRANE - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;ONE day a Wolf, who was eating his dinner much too fast, swallowed a&#xD;bone, which stuck in his throat and pained him very much. He tried to&#xD;get it out, but could not.&#xD;&#xD;Just then he saw a Crane passing by. “Dear friend,” said he to the&#xD;Crane, “there is a bone sticking in my throat. You have a good long&#xD;neck; can’t you reach down and pull it out? I will pay you well for it.”&#xD;&#xD;“I’ll try,” said the Crane. Then he put his head into the Wolf’s mouth,&#xD;between his sharp teeth, and reaching down, pulled out the bone.&#xD;&#xD;“There!” said the Wolf, “I am glad it is out; I must be more careful&#xD;another time.”&#xD;&#xD;“I will go now, if you will pay me,” said the Crane.&#xD;&#xD;“Pay you, indeed!” cried the Wolf. “Be thankful that I did not bite&#xD;your head off when it was in my mouth. You ought to be content with&#xD;that.”&#xD;&#xD;       *       *       *       *       *&#xD;&#xD;Gentle, kindly folk sometimes have to learn that kindness must be mixed&#xD;with caution.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPERS - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;THE Ants and the Grasshoppers lived together in the great field. The&#xD;Ants were busy all the time gathering a store of grain to lay by for&#xD;winter use. They gave themselves so little pleasure that their merry&#xD;neighbors, the Grasshoppers, began at last to take scarcely any notice&#xD;of them.&#xD;&#xD;When the frost came, it put an end to the work of the Ants and the&#xD;chirping and merrymaking of the Grasshoppers. But one fine winter’s&#xD;day, when the Ants were employed in spreading their grain in the sun to&#xD;dry, a Grasshopper, who was nearly perishing with hunger, chanced to&#xD;pass by.&#xD;&#xD;“Good day to you, kind neighbor,” said she; “will you not lend me a&#xD;little food? I will certainly pay you before this time next year.”&#xD;&#xD;“How does it happen that you have no food of your own?” asked an old&#xD;Ant. “There was an abundance in the field where we lived side by side&#xD;all summer, and your people seemed to be active enough. What were you&#xD;doing, pray?”&#xD;&#xD;“Oh,” said the Grasshopper, forgetting his hunger, “I sang all the day&#xD;long, and all the night, too.”&#xD;&#xD;“Well, then,” interrupted the Ant, “I must not deprive my own family&#xD;for you. If Grasshoppers find it so gay to sing away the summer, they&#xD;must starve in winter,” and she went on with her work, all the while&#xD;singing the old song, “We ants never borrow; we ants never lend.”&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE FROGS WHO ASKED FOR A KING - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;THERE were once some Frogs who lived together in perfect security in a&#xD;beautiful lake. They were a large company, and were very comfortable,&#xD;but they came to think that they might be still happier if they had a&#xD;King to rule over them.&#xD;&#xD;So they sent to Jupiter, their god, to ask him to give them a King.&#xD;&#xD;Jupiter laughed at their folly, for he knew that they were better off&#xD;as they were; but he said to them, “Well, here is a King for you,” and&#xD;into the water he threw a big Log.&#xD;&#xD;It fell with such a splash that the Frogs were terrified and hid&#xD;themselves in the deep mud under the water.&#xD;&#xD;By and by, one braver than the rest peeped out to look at the King, and&#xD;saw the Log, as it lay quietly on the top of the water. Soon, one after&#xD;another they all came out of their hiding places and ventured to look&#xD;at their great King.&#xD;&#xD;As the Log did not move, they swam round it, keeping a safe distance&#xD;away, and at last one by one hopped upon it.&#xD;&#xD;“This is not a King,” said a wise old Frog; “it is nothing but a stupid&#xD;Log. If we had a King, Jupiter would pay more attention to us.”&#xD;&#xD;Again they sent to Jupiter, and begged him to give them a King who&#xD;could rule over them.&#xD;&#xD;[Illustration]&#xD;&#xD;Jupiter did not like to be disturbed again by the silly Frogs, and this&#xD;time he sent them a Stork, saying, “You will have some one to rule&#xD;over you now.”&#xD;&#xD;As they saw the Stork solemnly walking down to the lake, they were&#xD;delighted.&#xD;&#xD;“Ah!” they said, “see how grand he looks! How he strides along! How he&#xD;throws back his head! This is a King indeed. He shall rule over us,”&#xD;and they went joyfully to meet him.&#xD;&#xD;As their new King came nearer, he paused, stretched out his long neck,&#xD;picked up the head Frog, and swallowed him at one mouthful. And then&#xD;the next—and the next!&#xD;&#xD;“What is this?” cried the Frogs, and they began to draw back in terror.&#xD;&#xD;But the Stork with his long legs easily followed them to the water, and&#xD;kept on eating them as fast as he could.&#xD;&#xD;“Oh! if we had only been—” said the oldest Frog. He was going to add&#xD;“content,” but was eaten up before he could finish the sentence.&#xD;&#xD;The remaining Frogs cried to Jupiter to help them, but he would not&#xD;listen. And the Stork-King ate them for breakfast, dinner, and supper,&#xD;every day, till in a short time there was not a Frog left in the lake.&#xD;Poor, foolish Frogs, not to have known when they were well off.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;___&#xD;&#xD;THE DONKEY IN THE LION’S SKIN - &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;A DONKEY once put on a Lion’s skin which some hunters had spread out&#xD;to dry. It did not fit the Donkey very well, but he found that in it&#xD;he could frighten all the timid, foolish little animals, so he amused&#xD;himself by chasing them about.&#xD;&#xD;By and by he met a Fox, and tried to frighten him by roaring.&#xD;&#xD;“My dear Donkey,” said the wise Fox, “you are braying, and not roaring.&#xD;I might, perhaps, have been frightened by your looks, if you had not&#xD;tried to roar; but I know your voice too well to mistake you for a&#xD;Lion.”</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Aesop_x0020_fables><textEntry_Alice_x2019_s_x0020_Adventures_x0020_in_x0020_Wonderland i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</title><text i:type="x:string">Down the Rabbit-Hole. Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.' Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ['which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.' And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. 'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Alice_x2019_s_x0020_Adventures_x0020_in_x0020_Wonderland><textEntry_A-Z i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">A-Z</title><text i:type="x:string">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">false</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_A-Z><textEntry_Beowulf i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Beowulf</title><text i:type="x:string">{The famous race of Spear-Danes.}&#xD;&#xD;          Lo! the Spear-Danes' glory through splendid achievements&#xD;          The folk-kings' former fame we have heard of,&#xD;          How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.&#xD;&#xD;{Scyld, their mighty king, in honor of whom they are often called&#xD;Scyldings.

So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence. Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip. "Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!” A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin. "Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do it, sir.” "Tell us your name!” said the man. "Quick!” "Pip, sir.” "Once more,” said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!” "Pip. Pip, sir.” "Show us where you live,” said the man. "Pint out the place!” I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church. The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When the church came to itself,--for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously. "You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you ha' got.” I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and not strong. "Darn me if I couldn't eat em,” said the man, with a threatening shake of his head, "and if I han't half a mind to't!” I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying. "Now lookee here!” said the man. "Where's your mother?” "There, sir!” said I. He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder. "There, sir!” I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. That's my mother.” "Oh!” said he, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your mother?” "Yes, sir,” said I; "him too; late of this parish.” "Ha!” he muttered then, considering. "Who d'ye live with,--supposin' you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?” "My sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir.” "Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg. After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into his. "Now lookee here,” he said, "the question being whether you're to be let to live. You know what a file is?” "Yes, sir.” "And you know what wittles is?” "Yes, sir.” After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger. "You get me a file.” He tilted me again. "And you get me wittles.” He tilted me again. "You bring 'em both to me.” He tilted me again. "Or I'll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again. I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands, and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.” He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:-- "You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what do you say?” I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in the morning. "Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!” said the man. I said so, and he took me down. "Now,” he pursued, "you remember what you've undertook, and you remember that young man, and you get home!” "Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered. "Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. "I wish I was a frog. Or a eel!” At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in. When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in. The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping. Chapter II My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up "by hand.” Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me,</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Great_x0020_Expectations><textEntry_Jane_x0020_Eyre_x002C__x0020_an_x0020_Autobiography i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Jane Eyre, an Autobiography</title><text i:type="x:string">There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast. I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-- "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides." Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold." Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking. I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide. The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms. The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror. So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows. Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland. With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast- room door opened. "Boh! Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty. "Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad animal!" "It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once-- "She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack." And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack. "What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence. "Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer. "I want you to come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him. John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health." Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home. John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back. Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair. "That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he, "and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!" Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult. "What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked. "I was reading." "Show the book." I returned to the window and fetched it thence. "You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows." I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded. "Wicked and cruel boy!" I said. "You are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!" I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud. "What! what!" he cried. "Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Jane_x0020_Eyre_x002C__x0020_an_x0020_Autobiography><textEntry_Notre-Dame_x0020_de_x0020_Paris i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Notre-Dame de Paris</title><text i:type="x:string">Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal. The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning. It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor an entry of "our much dread lord, monsieur the king," nor even a pretty hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon, who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very "pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce," while a driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door. What put the "whole population of Paris in commotion," as Jehan de Troyes expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools. On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a maypole at the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost's men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts. So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of the three spots designated. Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another, the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque. The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall. It was no easy matter on that day, to force one's way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,--the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost's sergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the _maréchaussée_, the _maréchaussée_ to our _gendarmeri_ of Paris. * The word Gothic, in the sense in which it is generally employed, is wholly unsuitable, but wholly consecrated. Hence we accept it and we adopt it, like all the rest of the world, to characterize the architecture of the second half of the Middle Ages, where the ogive is the principle which succeeds the architecture of the first period, of which the semi-circle is the father. Thousands of good, calm, bourgeois faces thronged the windows, the doors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace, gazing at the populace, and asking nothing more; for many Parisians content themselves with the spectacle of the spectators, and a wall behind which something is going on becomes at once, for us, a very curious thing indeed. If it could be granted to us, the men of 1830, to mingle in thought with those Parisians of the fifteenth century, and to enter with them, jostled, elbowed, pulled about, into that immense hall of the palace, which was so cramped on that sixth of January, 1482, the spectacle would not be devoid of either interest or charm, and we should have about us only things that were so old that they would seem new. With the reader's consent, we will endeavor to retrace in thought, the impression which he would have experienced in company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless jackets, and doublets. And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement in the eyes. Above our heads is a double ogive vault, panelled with wood carving, painted azure, and sown with golden fleurs-de-lis; beneath our feet a pavement of black and white marble, alternating. A few paces distant, an enormous pillar, then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault, in the centre of its width. Around four of the pillars, stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk hose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys. Around the hall, along the lofty wall, between the doors, between the windows, between the pillars, the interminable row of all the kings of France, from Pharamond down: the lazy kings, with pendent arms and downcast eyes; the valiant and combative kings, with heads and arms raised boldly heavenward. Then in the long, pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues; at the wide entrances to the hall, rich doors, finely sculptured; and all, the vaults, pillars, walls, jambs, panelling, doors, statues, covered from top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination, which, a trifle tarnished at the epoch when we behold it, had almost entirely disappeared beneath dust and spiders in the year of grace, 1549, when du Breul still admired it from tradition. Let the reader picture to himself now, this immense, oblong hall, illuminated by the pallid light of a January day, invaded by a motley and noisy throng which drifts along the walls, and eddies round the seven pillars, and he will have a confused idea of the whole effect of the picture, whose curious details we shall make an effort to indicate with more precision. It is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV., there would have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac deposited in the clerk's office of the Palais de Justice, no accomplices interested in causing the said documents to disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged, for lack of better means, to burn the clerk's office in order to burn the documents, and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the clerk's office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618. The old Palais would be standing still, with its ancient grand hall; I should be able to say to the reader, "Go and look at it," and we should thus both escape the necessity,--I of making, and he of reading, a description of it, such as it is. Which demonstrates a new truth: that great events have incalculable results. It is true that it may be quite possible, in the first place, that Ravaillac had no accomplices; and in the second, that if he had any, they were in no way connected with the fire of 1618. Two other very plausible explanations exist: First, the great flaming star, a foot broad, and a cubit high, which fell from heaven, as every one knows, upon the law courts, after midnight on the seventh of March; second, Théophile's quatrain,-- "Sure, 'twas but a sorry game When at Paris, Dame Justice, Through having eaten too much spice, Set the palace all aflame." Whatever may be thought of this triple explanation, political, physical, and poetical, of the burning of the law courts in 1618, the unfortunate fact of the fire is certain. Very little to-day remains, thanks to this catastrophe,--thanks, above all, to the successive restorations which have completed what it spared,--very little remains of that first dwelling of the kings of France,--of that elder palace of the Louvre, already so old in the time of Philip the Handsome, that they sought there for the traces of the magnificent buildings erected by King Robert and described by Helgaldus. Nearly everything has disappeared. What has become of the chamber of the chancellery, where Saint Louis consummated his marriage? the garden where he administered justice, "clad in a coat of camelot, a</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Notre-Dame_x0020_de_x0020_Paris><textEntry_Oliver_x0020_Twist i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Oliver Twist</title><text i:type="x:string">Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons&#xD;it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will&#xD;assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,&#xD;great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on&#xD;a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as&#xD;it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of&#xD;the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is&#xD;prefixed to the head of this chapter.&#xD;&#xD;For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and&#xD;trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable&#xD;doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which&#xD;case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never&#xD;have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of&#xD;pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the&#xD;most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the&#xD;literature of any age or country.&#xD;&#xD;Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a&#xD;workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance&#xD;that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this&#xD;particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could&#xD;by possibility have occurred.  The fact is, that there was considerable&#xD;difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of&#xD;respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered&#xD;necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a&#xD;little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and&#xD;the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,&#xD;if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful&#xD;grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of&#xD;profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been&#xD;killed in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old&#xD;woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;&#xD;and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and&#xD;Nature fought out the point between them.  The result was, that, after&#xD;a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise&#xD;to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been&#xD;imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could&#xD;reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been&#xD;possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer&#xD;space of time than three minutes and a quarter.&#xD;&#xD;As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his&#xD;lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron&#xD;bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly&#xD;from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,&#xD;'Let me see the child, and die.'&#xD;&#xD;The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:&#xD;giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the&#xD;young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with&#xD;more kindness than might have been expected of him:&#xD;&#xD;'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'&#xD;&#xD;'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily&#xD;depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which&#xD;she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.&#xD;&#xD;'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,&#xD;and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two,&#xD;and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in&#xD;that way, bless her dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother,&#xD;there's a dear young lamb do.'&#xD;&#xD;Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed&#xD;in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her head, and stretched&#xD;out her hand towards the child.&#xD;&#xD;The surgeon deposited it in her arms.  She imprinted her cold white&#xD;lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face;&#xD;gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her&#xD;breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They&#xD;talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.&#xD;&#xD;'It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.&#xD;&#xD;'Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the&#xD;green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to&#xD;take up the child.  'Poor dear!'&#xD;&#xD;'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said&#xD;the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very&#xD;likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.'  He&#xD;put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,&#xD;added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?'&#xD;&#xD;'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the&#xD;overseer's order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had walked&#xD;some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came&#xD;from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.'&#xD;&#xD;The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  'The old&#xD;story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!&#xD;Good-night!'&#xD;&#xD;The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once&#xD;more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair&#xD;before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.&#xD;&#xD;What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist&#xD;was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only&#xD;covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it&#xD;would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him&#xD;his proper station in society.  But now that he was enveloped in the&#xD;old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was&#xD;badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish&#xD;child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to&#xD;be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied&#xD;by none.&#xD;&#xD;Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,&#xD;left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he&#xD;would have cried the louder.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;CHAPTER II&#xD;&#xD;TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD&#xD;&#xD;For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic&#xD;course of treachery and deception.  He was brought up by hand.  The&#xD;hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported&#xD;by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.  The parish&#xD;authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether&#xD;there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a&#xD;situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of&#xD;which he stood in need.  The workhouse authorities replied with&#xD;humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities&#xD;magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,'&#xD;or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse&#xD;some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders&#xD;against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the&#xD;inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental&#xD;superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and&#xD;for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.&#xD;Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child;&#xD;a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to&#xD;overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was&#xD;a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;&#xD;and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.&#xD;So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own&#xD;use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter&#xD;allowance than was originally provided for them.  Thereby finding in&#xD;the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great&#xD;experimental philosopher.&#xD;&#xD;Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a&#xD;great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who&#xD;demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw&#xD;a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and&#xD;rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,&#xD;four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable&#xD;bait of air.  Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the&#xD;female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a&#xD;similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at&#xD;the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest&#xD;possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen&#xD;in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want&#xD;and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by&#xD;accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was&#xD;usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers&#xD;it had never known in this.&#xD;&#xD;Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest&#xD;upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,&#xD;or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a&#xD;washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything&#xD;approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury&#xD;would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the&#xD;parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a&#xD;remonstrance.  But these impertinences were speedily checked by the&#xD;evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of&#xD;whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was&#xD;very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever&#xD;the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board&#xD;made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the&#xD;day before, to say they were go</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Oliver_x0020_Twist><textEntry_Random_x0020_lowercase i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Random lowercase</title><text i:type="x:string">__rnd 1-7__&#xD;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">false</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">1</version></textEntry_Random_x0020_lowercase><textEntry_Random_x0020_symbols i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Random symbols</title><text i:type="x:string">__rnd 1__&#xD;%"{}$?'()|\[]@~&amp;^-./*+=&lt;&gt;_;:,!#</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">false</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Random_x0020_symbols><textEntry_Random_x0020_uppercase i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Random uppercase</title><text i:type="x:string">__rnd 1-7__&#xD;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">false</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">1</version></textEntry_Random_x0020_uppercase><textEntry_The_x0020_Adventures_x0020_of_x0020_Tom_x0020_Sawyer i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</title><text i:type="x:string">"TOM!" No answer. "TOM!" No answer. "What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. "I never did see the beat of that boy!" She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted: "Y-o-u-u TOM!" There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. "There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?" "Nothing." "Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that truck?" "I don't know, aunt." "Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch." The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate-- "My! Look behind you, aunt!" The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared over it. His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh. "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for "afternoon"] I'll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child." Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she: "Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?" "Yes'm." "Powerful warm, warn't it?" "Yes'm." "Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?" A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said: "No'm--well, not very much." The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said: "But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move: "Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?" Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration: "Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!" The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed. "Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time." She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once. But Sidney said: "Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's black." "Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!" But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said: "Siddy, I'll lick you for that." In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said: "She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!" He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well though--and loathed him. Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer. The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said: "I can lick you!" "I'd like to see you try it." "Well, I can do it." "No you can't, either." "Yes I can." "No you can't." "I can." "You can't." "Can!" "Can't!" An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said: "What's your name?" "'Tisn't any of your business, maybe." "Well I 'low I'll _make_ it my business." "Well why don't you?" "If you say much, I will." "Much--much--_much_. There now." "Oh, you think you're mighty smart, _don't_ you? I could lick you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to." "Well why don't you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it." "Well I _will_, if you fool with me." "Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix." "Smarty! You think you're _some_, now, _don't_ you? Oh, what a hat!" "You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs." "You're a liar!" "You're another." "You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up." "Aw--take a walk!" "Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head." "Oh, of _course_ you will." "Well I _will_." "Well why don't you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will for? Why don't you _do_ it? It's because you're afraid." "I _ain't_ afraid." "You are." "I ain't." "You are." Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said: "Get away from here!" "Go away yourself!" "I won't." "I won't either." So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glow</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Adventures_x0020_of_x0020_Tom_x0020_Sawyer><textEntry_The_x0020_Awakening i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Awakening</title><text i:type="x:string">A green and yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept repeating over and over: "Allez vous-en! Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!” He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody understood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence. Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort, arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust. He walked down the gallery and across the narrow "bridges” which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated before the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining. He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before. Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed. Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building was called "the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages. The chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from "Zampa” upon the piano. Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's two children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air. Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post. "What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the morning seemed long to him. "You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile. "What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards. "Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier. "Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed her husband as he prepared to leave. "Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away. "Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein's and the size of "the game.” He did not say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him. Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts. II Mrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish brown, about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought. Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging. Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke. This seemed quite proper and natural on his part. In coloring he was not unlike his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day. Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around them; their amusing adventure out in the water--it had again assumed its entertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the Cheniere; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to "The Poet and the Peasant.” Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not know any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason. Each was interested in what the other said. Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him. He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there. Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent. He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at Grand Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, "the house” had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its dozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the "Quartier Francais,” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright. Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country. She was an American woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution. She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married. Robert was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead. When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner. "I see Leonce isn't coming back,” she said, with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared. Robert supposed he was not, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein's. When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where, during the half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the little Pontellier children, who were very fond of him. III It was eleven o'clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein's hotel. He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very talkative. His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in. He talked to her while he undressed, telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day. From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin, which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and whatever else happened to be in his pockets. She was overcome with sleep, and answered him with little half utterances. He thought it very d</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Awakening><textEntry_The_x0020_Count_x0020_of_x0020_Monte_x0020_Cristo i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Count of Monte Cristo</title><text i:type="x:string">On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chateau d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island. Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot. The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin. When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks. He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger. "Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. "What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?” "A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, "a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.” "And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly. "Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere----” "What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. "What happened to the worthy captain?” "He died.” "Fell into the sea?” "No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, "Bear a hand there, to take in sail!” All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner. "And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation. 0023m "Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, "to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.” "Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every moment, "we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo----” "Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.” Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: "Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!” The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man- of-war. "Let go--and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards. "Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, "here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.” The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them. "Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, "you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?” "Yes--yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.” "And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel &amp; Son,” replied Danglars. "But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, "it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.” "Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. "Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.” 0025m "As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, "that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.” "The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.” "Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, "come this way!” "In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, "and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, "Let go!” The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, "Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!” "You see,” said Danglars, "he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.” "And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner. "Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.” "And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; "he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.” A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow. "Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, "the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?” Danglars retreated a step or two. "I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?” "I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.” "Then did you see him, Edmond?” "Who?” "The marshal.” "Yes.” Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly-- "And how is the emperor?” "Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.” "You saw the emperor, then?” "He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.” "And you spoke to him?” "Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile. "And what did he say to you?” "Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &amp; Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’” "Pardieu! and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. "And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, "you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.” 0027m "How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; "for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,-- "Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Count_x0020_of_x0020_Monte_x0020_Cristo><textEntry_The_x0020_Gospels i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Gospels</title><text i:type="x:string">__bible__&#xD;Revised King James New Testament</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Gospels><textEntry_The_x0020_Life_x0020_and_x0020_Adventures_x0020_of_x0020_Robinson_x0020_Crusoe i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</title><text i:type="x:string">I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,&#xD;though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who&#xD;settled first at Hull.  He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving&#xD;off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my&#xD;mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that&#xD;country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the&#xD;usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call&#xD;ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called&#xD;me.&#xD;&#xD;I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an&#xD;English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous&#xD;Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the&#xD;Spaniards.  What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than&#xD;my father or mother knew what became of me.&#xD;&#xD;Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head&#xD;began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.  My father, who was&#xD;very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as&#xD;house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me&#xD;for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and&#xD;my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the&#xD;commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of&#xD;my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in&#xD;that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which&#xD;was to befall me.&#xD;&#xD;My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel&#xD;against what he foresaw was my design.  He called me one morning into his&#xD;chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly&#xD;with me upon this subject.  He asked me what reasons, more than a mere&#xD;wandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my native&#xD;country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising&#xD;my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.&#xD;He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring,&#xD;superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise&#xD;by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out&#xD;of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or&#xD;too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called&#xD;the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,&#xD;was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not&#xD;exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the&#xD;mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,&#xD;ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.  He told me I might&#xD;judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was&#xD;the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have&#xD;frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great&#xD;things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two&#xD;extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his&#xD;testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have&#xD;neither poverty nor riches.&#xD;&#xD;He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of&#xD;life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the&#xD;middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many&#xD;vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not&#xD;subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,&#xD;as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the&#xD;one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or&#xD;insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by&#xD;the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station&#xD;of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments;&#xD;that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that&#xD;temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable&#xD;diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the&#xD;middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly&#xD;through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the&#xD;labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for&#xD;daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the&#xD;soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy,&#xD;or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy&#xD;circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the&#xD;sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and&#xD;learning by every day’s experience to know it more sensibly.&#xD;&#xD;After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner,&#xD;not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which&#xD;nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided&#xD;against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would&#xD;do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life&#xD;which he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very&#xD;easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must&#xD;hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus&#xD;discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be&#xD;to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I&#xD;would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so&#xD;much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away;&#xD;and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to&#xD;whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into&#xD;the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting&#xD;him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he&#xD;would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that&#xD;if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should&#xD;have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when&#xD;there might be none to assist in my recovery.&#xD;&#xD;I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic,&#xD;though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself—I say, I&#xD;observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he&#xD;spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having&#xD;leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke&#xD;off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more&#xD;to me.&#xD;&#xD;I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be&#xD;otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to&#xD;settle at home according to my father’s desire.  But alas! a few days&#xD;wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further&#xD;importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from&#xD;him.  However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my&#xD;resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a&#xD;little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so&#xD;entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to&#xD;anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had&#xD;better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now&#xD;eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or&#xD;clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out&#xD;my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time&#xD;was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go&#xD;one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go&#xD;no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time&#xD;that I had lost.&#xD;&#xD;This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be&#xD;to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew&#xD;too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for&#xD;my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after&#xD;the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender&#xD;expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if&#xD;I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I&#xD;should never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not&#xD;have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say&#xD;that my mother was willing when my father was not.&#xD;&#xD;Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards&#xD;that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after&#xD;showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might&#xD;be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the&#xD;most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”&#xD;&#xD;It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in&#xD;the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling&#xD;to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about&#xD;their being so positively determined against what they knew my&#xD;inclinations prompted me to.  But being one day at Hull, where I went&#xD;casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;&#xD;but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to&#xD;London in his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them with the&#xD;common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my&#xD;passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as&#xD;sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might,&#xD;without asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without any consideration&#xD;of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the&#xD;1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.

There are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,--logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to 'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi, 33. 18). Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C), intended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws iii. 698 ff.), singing a hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire--'How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!' or, more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias). Again, Plato may be regarded as the 'captain' ('arhchegoz') or leader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God, of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature on politics. Even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand' (Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a dream by him. The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old man--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and Polemarchus--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by Socrates--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality, and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual and the State. We are thus led on to the conception of a higher State, in which 'no man calls anything his own,' and in which there is neither 'marrying nor giving in marriage,' and 'kings are philosophers' and 'philosophers are kings;' and there is another and higher education, intellectual as well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When 'the wheel has come full circle' we do not begin again with a new period of human life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. The subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation of a future life. The division into books, like all similar divisions (Cp. Sir G.C. Lewis in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p 1.), is probably later than the age of Plato. The natural divisions are five in number;--(1) Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, 'I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,' which is introductory; the first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without arriving at any definite result. To this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question--What is justice, stripped of appearances? The second division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the construction of the first State and the first education. The third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject of enquiry, and the second State is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Republic><textEntry_The_x0020_Time_x0020_Machine i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">The Time Machine</title><text i:type="x:string">The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was&#xD;expounding a recondite matter to us.

The geometry, for instance,&#xD;they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”&#xD;&#xD;“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said&#xD;Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.&#xD;&#xD;“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground&#xD;for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of&#xD;course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real&#xD;existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.&#xD;These things are mere abstractions.”&#xD;&#xD;“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.&#xD;&#xD;“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a&#xD;real existence.”&#xD;&#xD;“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All&#xD;real things—”&#xD;&#xD;“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube&#xD;exist?”&#xD;&#xD;“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.&#xD;&#xD;“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real&#xD;existence?”&#xD;&#xD;Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any&#xD;real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have&#xD;Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural&#xD;infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we&#xD;incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three&#xD;which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,&#xD;however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former&#xD;three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our&#xD;consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter&#xD;from the beginning to the end of our lives.”&#xD;&#xD;“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his&#xD;cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”&#xD;&#xD;“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”&#xD;continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.&#xD;“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some&#xD;people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It&#xD;is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between&#xD;Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our&#xD;consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of&#xD;the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say&#xD;about this Fourth Dimension?”&#xD;&#xD;“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.&#xD;&#xD;“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is&#xD;spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,&#xD;Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three&#xD;planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical&#xD;people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not&#xD;another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even&#xD;tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb&#xD;was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month&#xD;or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two&#xD;dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and&#xD;similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could&#xD;represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the&#xD;thing. See?”&#xD;&#xD;“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,&#xD;he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who&#xD;repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some&#xD;time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.&#xD;&#xD;“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry&#xD;of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For&#xD;instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at&#xD;fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All&#xD;these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional&#xD;representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and&#xD;unalterable thing.&#xD;&#xD;“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause&#xD;required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time&#xD;is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a&#xD;weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of&#xD;the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then&#xD;this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the&#xD;mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space&#xD;generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that&#xD;line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”&#xD;&#xD;“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if&#xD;Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has&#xD;it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move&#xD;in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”&#xD;&#xD;The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in&#xD;Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,&#xD;and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.&#xD;But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”&#xD;&#xD;“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”&#xD;&#xD;“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the&#xD;inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”&#xD;&#xD;“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.&#xD;&#xD;“Easier, far easier down than up.”&#xD;&#xD;“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the&#xD;present moment.”&#xD;&#xD;“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the&#xD;whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present&#xD;moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no&#xD;dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform&#xD;velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_&#xD;if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”&#xD;&#xD;“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You&#xD;_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about&#xD;in Time.”&#xD;&#xD;“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that&#xD;we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an&#xD;incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I&#xD;become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course&#xD;we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than&#xD;a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a&#xD;civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go&#xD;up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that&#xD;ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the&#xD;Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”&#xD;&#xD;“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”&#xD;&#xD;“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.&#xD;&#xD;“It’s against reason,” said Filby.&#xD;&#xD;“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.&#xD;&#xD;“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will&#xD;never convince me.”&#xD;&#xD;“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the&#xD;object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long&#xD;ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”&#xD;&#xD;“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.&#xD;&#xD;“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as&#xD;the driver determines.”&#xD;&#xD;Filby contented himself with laughter.&#xD;&#xD;“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.&#xD;&#xD;“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist&#xD;suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of&#xD;the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”&#xD;&#xD;“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.&#xD;“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”&#xD;&#xD;“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the&#xD;Very Young Man thought.&#xD;&#xD;“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The&#xD;German scholars have improved Greek so much.”&#xD;&#xD;“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One&#xD;might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and&#xD;hurry on ahead!”&#xD;&#xD;“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic&#xD;basis.”&#xD;&#xD;“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.&#xD;&#xD;“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”&#xD;&#xD;“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”&#xD;&#xD;“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.&#xD;&#xD;“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s&#xD;all humbug, you know.”&#xD;&#xD;The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and&#xD;with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of&#xD;the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to&#xD;his laboratory.&#xD;&#xD;The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”&#xD;&#xD;“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby&#xD;tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he&#xD;had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s&#xD;anecdote collapsed.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD; II&#xD;&#xD;&#xD; The Machine&#xD;&#xD;The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic&#xD;framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately&#xD;made.

A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of fate! Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it. Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted? John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage. John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. John is a physician, and perhaps--(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)--perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster. You see, he does not believe I am sick! And what can one do? If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one to do? My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing. So I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work” until I am well again. Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good. But what is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition. I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people. There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden--large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them. There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now. There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years. That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care--there is something strange about the house--I can feel it. I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window. I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition. But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself,--before him, at least,--and that makes me very tired. I don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it. He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another. He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more. He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear,” said he, "and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the top of the house. It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls. The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is stripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life. One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin. It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions. The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight. It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others. No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long. There comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a word. We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before, since that first day. I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength. John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious. I am glad my case is not serious! But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing. John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him. Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way! I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already! Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able--to dress and entertain, and order things. It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby! And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous. I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wallpaper! At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies. He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on. "You know the place is doing you good,” he said, "and really, dear, I don’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.” "Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, "there are such pretty rooms there.” Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain. But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things. It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim. I’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper. Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees. Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try. I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me. But I find I get pretty tired when I try. It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now. I wish I could get well faster. But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had! There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down. I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other. I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy-store. I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend. I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe. The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here. The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as hatred. Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found in the roo</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_The_x0020_Yellow_x0020_Wallpaper><textEntry_Touch_x0020_typing i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Touch typing</title><text i:type="x:string">A touch typist starts by placing their fingers on the "start position" in the middle row and knows which finger to move and how much to move it for reaching any required key. Learning typically includes first printing exercises containing only letters on or near the standard position and then gradually mastering other rows. It is important to learn placing fingers into the start position blindly as the hands are frequently raised from the keyboard to operate the line feed lever (in the past) or (more recently) the computer mouse. The keys F and J frequently contain some surface features that allow the typist to recognize them by touch alone, thus removing the need to look down at the keys to reset the fingers at the home row.&#xD;&#xD;The typing speed can be increased gradually and speeds of 60 WPM or higher can be achieved. The rate of speed increase varies between individuals. Many websites and software products are available to learn touch typing and many of these are free. Learning touch typing can be stressful both to the fingers as well as the mind in the beginning, but once it is learned to a decent level, it exerts minimal stress on the fingers.[12] For individuals with past typing experience, learning to touch type is particularly difficult due to motivational reasons: the initial performance level in touch typing is far lower than in visually guided typing; therefore it does not initially seem worthwhile to study touch typing.[13]&#xD;&#xD;Typing speed generally improves with practice. While practicing, it is important to ensure that there are no weak keys. Typing speed is typically determined by how slow these weak keys are typed rather than how fast the remaining keys are typed. If a stage is reached where irrespective of the amount of practice, typing speed is not increasing, it is advisable to let some time pass and continue serious practice thereafter as typing speeds typically tend to increase with time even when no serious practice is done.&#xD;Home row.&#xD;The "home row" is the center row of keys on a typewriter or computer keyboard. On the most common type of English language keyboard, the QWERTY layout, "A S D F" and "J K L ;" are the home keys on the home row.[14]&#xD;&#xD;The middle row of the keyboard is termed "home row" because typists are trained to keep their fingers on these keys and/or return to them after pressing any other key that is not on the home row.&#xD;&#xD;Some keyboards have a small bump on certain keys of the home row. This helps returning the fingers to the home row for touch typing.&#xD;&#xD;For instance, to type the word poll on a QWERTY keyboard, one would place all of one's fingers on the home row. (The right hand should be covering "J K L ;" with the thumb on the space bar while the left hand covers "A S D F".) The typist will then use their little finger to reach for the "P" key located just above the semicolon and then return the little finger back to the semicolon key from which it originated. The ring finger, located on the "L" key will be moved directly upwards to press the "O" key and then back. Finally, the same ring finger will remain on the "L" key and press it twice. Experienced typists can do this at speeds of over 100 words per minute,[15] but the method is that they generally return their fingers to the home row when they are not in use.[14] This provides for quick, easy access to all of the keys on the keyboard. &#xD;&#xD;Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Touch_x0020_typing><textEntry_Treasure_x0020_Island i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Treasure Island</title><text i:type="x:string">The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof. I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!" in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard. "This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?" My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity. "Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at--there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," says he, looking as fierce as a commander. And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our guest. He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg" and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for "the seafaring man with one leg." How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies. But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with "Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum," all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a "true sea-dog" and a "real old salt" and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death. All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open. He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain, that is--began to pipe up his eternal song: "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!" At first I had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, fla</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Treasure_x0020_Island><textEntry_War_x0020_and_x0020_Peace i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">War and Peace</title><text i:type="x:string">“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news.” It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: “If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette Schérer.” “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned. “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?” “And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.” “I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.” “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed. “Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.” “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.” Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst out: “Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!” She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity. “I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?” “In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?” “I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.” Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron. Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with. “Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone. As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness. The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said: “Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.” The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude. “I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation--“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.” And she smiled her ecstatic smile. “I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.” “Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were pitied....” The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned. “What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant. “And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna, looking up pensively. “I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!” He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated. “Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.” Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information. “Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check th</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">true</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_War_x0020_and_x0020_Peace><textEntry_Z-A i:type="a:TextEntry" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><title i:type="x:string">Z-A</title><text i:type="x:string">zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba</text><asciiLetters i:type="x:boolean">false</asciiLetters><version i:type="x:int">0</version></textEntry_Z-A><globalStats i:type="a:GlobalStats" xmlns="" xmlns:a="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/TyperLib"><a:TotalWords>0</a:TotalWords><a:words xmlns:b="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"/></globalStats></UserData>
