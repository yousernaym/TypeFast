<h1>Privacy Policy for Type Fast</h1>
<p>This app may access files on your device to let you import previously exported texts for typing practice. Only files that you select will be accessed. User-provided texts, either imported from a file or entered directly into the app, are stored locally without encryption. They will not be accessed by anyone but you, but since they are stored unencrypted you should never provide any personal or sensitive information.</p>
